    "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, accounting for nearly 1 in 3 cancers diagnosed among women in the United States, and it is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. Breast Cancer occurs as a results of abnormal growth of cells in the breast tissue, commonly referred to as a Tumor. A tumor does not mean cancer - tumors can be benign (not cancerous), pre-malignant (pre-cancerous), or malignant (cancerous). Tests such as MRI, mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy are commonly used to diagnose breast cancer performed."

To create the dataset Dr. Wolberg used fluid samples, taken from patients with solid breast masses and an easy-to-use graphical computer program called Xcyt, which is capable of perform the analysis of cytological features based on a digital scan. The program uses a curve-fitting algorithm, to compute ten features from each one of the cells in the sample, than it calculates the mean value, extreme value and standard error of each feature for the image, returning a 30 real-valuated vector\n",
